                           <p>How could you save a mountain of money every month with our solar panels? It's because
                              we take advantage of the powerful photons from the sun to produce electricity on command.
                           </p>
                           <p>Now, you might ask, what is "photon"? Quite simply, sunlight consists of tiny particles,
                              which
                              are called "photon." The power of photon is measured by the wavelength, the longer the
                              wavelength, the weaker the photon.</p>

                           <p class="col_muted">On a sunny day, the photon from the sun will interact with our
                              solar panels, which are
                              designed to accept only powerful photons.</p>
                           <p> After hitting the solar cells, high-energy
                              photons
                              will excite electrons inside the system and produce electricity. Because photons from the
                              sun
                              are free, the average electricity price for using the solar
                              energy system is much lower than the traditional approaches.</p>

                        residential electricity rate increase from 12.13 to 13.04 cents per kilowatt-hour. Now, 7.00 vs.
                        13.04 might seem like no big deal, but let’s do some maths so that you can see how much

                     <p>The average American family uses about 10,972 kWh every year. If you use a traditional
                        approach, you have to pay about $1403 on electricity per year. But if you use our solar
                        energy system, the annual cost of electricity is only about $768. That means you will save
                        about $635 every year.</p>
                     <p>If the difference doesn’t seem significant enough, then let's look at the big picture. Our solar
                        power system's average lifetime is 25 years, so if you start using our system now, you will
                        save over $15,800 on electricity before replacing a new one.</p>

                     <h3 class="mt-5">What About The Loss Of Efficiency?</h3>
                     <p>We have to admit that our solar panels lose between 0.5% to 1% of their efficiency every
                        year. So after 25 years, they only can output about 75% of the original amount of power they
                        made when they were new.</p>
                     <p>Does the loss of efficiency affect the amount of money you can save every year? Yes, it
                        does. Due to the loss of efficiency, you may save $6.35 less every year, 50 cents less every
                        month.</p>
                     <p>But, it is not a big deal compared to $15,800+ that you can save by using our solar power
                        system, right?</p>
